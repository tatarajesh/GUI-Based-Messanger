This project implements a desktop messenger application using Java's Graphical User Interface (GUI) libraries. It offers core functionalities for casual communication:

User Management: Users can create new accounts for secure access. Existing users can login with their credentials.
Friend List and Chat Interface: Upon successful login, users can view a pre-defined static list of "friends." Each friend entry is linked to a chat window, allowing users to send and receive text messages.
Java Development Environment: The application is built using Java and its standard library (javax) for core functionalities. Additional Java packages may be utilized for specific functionalities.
Deliverable: The project will be delivered as a downloadable and executable JAR file, providing a standalone application for users.
 Note: This is a basic messenger with limited features. Future iterations can be developed to incorporate features like dynamic friend lists, user search functionalities, richer message formatting, and file transfer capabilities.
