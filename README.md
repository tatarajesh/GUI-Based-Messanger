# GUI-Based-Messanger
A project based on java.
 
GUI based program looks like a messenger, which has an option to create a new account. After signing up, which takes user login credentials to login. After successful logging, user will can see few static friends and chat boxes to send a text. In this we are using javax and other few packages to create a static messanger.
